I'm Travis McArthur. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Agricultural & Applied Economics Department of the University of Wisconsin--Madison. I will present my job market paper at the January 2017 AEA meeting.

My research examines the influence of firm heterogeneity on technical and allocative inefficiency. The context is smallholder agricultural production systems in Latin America.
