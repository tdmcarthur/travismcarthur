I'm Travis McArthur. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Agricultural & Applied Economics Department of the University of Wisconsin--Madison. In the fall of 2017 I will join the faculty of the Food & Resource Economics Department of the University of Florida as an assistant professor.

My research examines the influence of firm heterogeneity on technical and allocative inefficiency. The context is smallholder agricultural production systems in Latin America.
